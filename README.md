 Task-1: Given an array of integer nums sorted in non-decreasing order, find a given target value's first and last position. Suppose the target is not found in the array; return [-1, -1]. You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.  Also, write additional sample test cases to validate your implementation.
